# How it works

`sayit.sh` takes in ascii text and converts it into mp3, outputting it to the current working directory.

`hatchet.sh` cuts up the text into specified number of seconds and outputs the resulting mp3 into the current working directory.


# Initial seeding
An initial, uncut, and long mp3 file cat be generated by `cat`ing out the contents of a file to the `sayit.sh` script, which converts and encodes it into an mp3 file.

```
cat sample_text | sh sayit.sh
```

# Creating a file of a particular length
Users can create a 5 second clip via the command `sh hatchet.sh 5`, which outputs: `5_seconds.mp3`

# A note about the sample text
I lifted it from project gutenberg's edition of Dicken's "A Tale of Two Cities". I'm not ashamed. More people should read Dickens as it was intended: to be read aloud.
